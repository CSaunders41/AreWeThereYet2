# AreWeThereYet2 Development TODO
## Focused Predictive Movement System

**Goal**: Replace over-engineered pathfinding with smart, predictive movement that anticipates leader behavior.

**Key Insight**: The original AreWeThereYet's superiority comes from large movement steps + predictive positioning, not complex pathfinding.

### üîÑ Integration & Testing
- [ ] **Replace Current System**

  - [ ] Maintain existing `MovementExecutor` and `Mouse` utilities
  - [ ] Keep all existing interfaces for compatibility

- [ ] **Performance Testing**
  - [ ] Measure performance improvement vs. current system
  - [ ] Test with various leader movement patterns (walking, running, teleporting)

  - [ ] Test with different follow distances and scenarios

- [ ] **Debug & Refinement**
  - [ ] Add comprehensive logging for prediction accuracy
  - [ ] Track leader prediction success rate
  - [ ] Monitor movement efficiency metrics
  - [ ] Fine-tune prediction timeframes and step sizes

### ‚úÖ Phase 1 Success Criteria

  - [ ] Add context analysis logic (obstacle count, leader velocity, distance)
  - [ ] Create strategy selection based on detected context
  - [ ] Add context switching with hysteresis (prevent rapid switching)

- [ ] **Adaptive Learning System**
  - [ ] Track movement performance metrics (stuck events, efficiency, time-to-target)

## Development Standards

### üìù Code Quality
- **Focus on simplicity**: Each class should have a single, clear purpose
- **Prefer composition over inheritance**: Use dependency injection for testability
- **Comprehensive error handling**: Every ExileCore API call should be wrapped
- **Performance first**: Profile and optimize hot paths
- **Maintainable architecture**: Code should be easy to understand and modify

### üß™ Testing Strategy
- **Test each phase incrementally** before moving to the next
- **Validate on Windows/ExileCore** after each major change
- **Measure performance impact** of every new feature
- **Test edge cases**: Leader disconnection, rapid movement, obstacle scenarios
- **Regression testing**: Ensure new features don't break existing functionality

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Philosophy
- **Sensible defaults** that work out-of-the-box
- **Minimal required configuration** for basic functionality
- **Advanced options** for power users without overwhelming interface
- **Real-time adjustment** of key parameters for testing
